\section{Freyd's Theorem}\label{sec:freyd}

Freyd's theorem is a well-known result in category theory which states
that any small category which is complete for all small limits must be
a poset. This is the starting point for our development because the
nonconstructive argument that is used to prove this result suggests
that it might fail in a nonclassical setting.
\begin{thm}\label{thm:freyd:freyd}
  In any small category $\Ccat$ which is complete must be a poset.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose we have such a $\Ccat$. We wish to show that for any
  $A, B \in \Ccat$ that $\card{\hom(A, B)} \le 1$. Let's suppose that
  this is not the case, namely, that we have a pair of objects $A$ and
  $B$ so that $\card{\hom(A, B)} \ge 2$. Let us distinguish two
  morphisms $a \neq b \in \hom(A, B)$ for later purposes.. Since
  $\Ccat$ is small we know that the collection of all morphisms is a
  set, let us say of cardinality $\kappa$. Let us then form the
  product $C = \prod_{i \in \kappa} B$. This must exist since we have
  assumed the existence of all small limits. Now consider
  $\hom(A, C)$. We know that $\hom(A, C) \subset X$ where $X$ is
  \[
    X = \{\langle x_i \rangle_{i \in \kappa}\mid \forall i.\ x_i \in \{a, b\}\}
  \]
  However, $\card{X} = 2^\kappa$, contradicting our assumption that
  the cardinality of the set of morphisms is $\kappa$.
\end{proof}

What is especially interesting is this result is that it can be
generalized from applying to just a boolean topos, such as $\set$ to
any topos which is based on top of $\set$ with an object of
generators! In particular, we can generalize this result to any
internal category to a Grothendieck topos. This result was concisely
proven by \citet{Gubkin:10} and is restated below.
\begin{thm}\label{thm:freyd:grothendieck}
  In any category $\Ccat$ internal to a topos $\Etop$ based on $\set$
  which is complete must be a poset.
\end{thm}
